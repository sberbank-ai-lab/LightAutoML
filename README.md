LightAutoML project from Sberbank AI Lab AutoML group is the framework for automatic classification and regression model creation.

Current available tasks to solve:
- binary classification
- multiclass classification
- regression

Currently we work with datasets, where **each row is an object with its specific features and target**. Multitable datasets and sequences are now under contruction :)

**Note**: for automatic creation of interpretable models we use [`AutoWoE`](https://github.com/sberbank-ai-lab/AutoMLWhitebox) library made by our group as well.

# Installation
### Installation via pip from PyPI
To install LAMA framework on your machine:
```bash
pip install -U lightautoml
```
### Installation from sources with virtual environment creation
If you want to create a specific virtual environment for LAMA, you need to install  `python3-venv` system package and run the following command, which creates `lama_venv` virtual env with LAMA inside:
```bash
bash build_package.sh
```
To check this variant of installation and run all the demo scripts, use the command below:
```bash
bash test_package.sh
```
To install optional support for generating reports in pdf format run following commands:
```bash
# MacOS
brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi

# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libffi-dev shared-mime-info

# Fedora
sudo yum install redhat-rpm-config libffi-devel cairo pango gdk-pixbuf2

# Windows
# follow this tutorial https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html#windows

poetry install -E pdf
```
*******
# Docs generation
```bash
bash build_docs.sh
```

Builded official documentation for LightAutoML is available [`here`](https://lightautoml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Usage examples

To find out how to work with LightAutoML, we have several tutorials:
1. `Tutorial_1. Create your own pipeline.ipynb` [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sberbank-ai-lab/LightAutoML/blob/master/Tutorial_1.%20Create%20your%20own%20pipeline.ipynb) - shows how to create your own pipeline from specified blocks: pipelines for feature generation and feature selection, ML algorithms, hyperparameter optimization etc.
2. `Tutorial_2. AutoML pipeline preset.ipynb` [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sberbank-ai-lab/LightAutoML/blob/master/Tutorial_2.%20AutoML%20pipeline%20preset.ipynb) - shows how to use LightAutoML presets (both standalone and time utilized variants) for solving ML tasks on tabular data. Using presets you can solve binary classification, multiclass classification and regression tasks, changing the first argument in Task.
3. `Tutorial_3. Multiclass task.ipynb` [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sberbank-ai-lab/LightAutoML/blob/master/Tutorial_3.%20Multiclass%20task.ipynb) - shows how to build ML pipeline for multiclass ML task by hand
4. `Tutorial_4. SQL data source for pipeline preset.ipynb` [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sberbank-ai-lab/LightAutoML/blob/master/Tutorial_4.%20SQL%20data%20source%20for%20pipeline%20preset.ipynb) - shows how to use LightAutoML presets (both standalone and time utilized variants) for solving ML tasks on tabular data from SQL data base instead of CSV.

Each tutorial has the step to enable Profiler and completes with Profiler run, which generates distribution for each function call time and shows it in interactive HTML report: the report show full time of run on its top and interactive tree of calls with percent of total time spent by the specific subtree.

**Important 1**: for production you have no need to use profiler (which increase work time and memory consomption), so please do not turn it on - it is in off state by default

**Important 2**: to take a look at this report after the run, please comment last line of demo with report deletion command.
